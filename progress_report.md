<h1> Predictive Analytics in NFL Progress Report </h1>
<h2> Daniel Schager</h2>
<p> The increasing reliance on data analytics in sports has transformed how teams and analysts assess performance, predict outcomes, and make decisions. However, leveraging predictive analytics in the NFL remains complex due to the vast amount of data, diverse data types, and the dynamic nature of the game. My project aims to create a comprehensive database and machine learning pipeline to predict player and team performances using historical and simulated data. By integrating advanced algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, and ridge/lasso regression, this project seeks to provide actionable insights for decision-making in player selection, game strategy, and forecasting performance.</p>
<p2> This semester, I focused on laying the groundwork for the project by defining the problem size/scope, designing the database structure, and implementing the preliminary phases of data generation and management. A major milestone was the design and creation of a PostgreSQL database to house various data tables, including teams, players, games, seasons, player statistics, and formations and plays. These tables were carefully structured to ensure data integrity and relationships, enabling easier analysis. For instance, unique identifiers such as UUIDs were used to establish connections between tables like games and teams or players and their respective statistics. I also developed a Python-based data generation script to simulate realistic NFL data using the Faker and NumPy libraries. This script generated detailed datasets that reflect the attributes and statistics of NFL players, teams, and games, which were then successfully inserted into the database. Throughout extensive testing, I resolved issues with data types, foreign key constraints, and UUID compatibility, ensuring the database was both functional and robust. From the machine learning perspective, I began exploring algorithms and identified the specific features to be used in the models. Features such as passing yards, rushing yards, tackles, and turnovers were selected for predictive tasks, and preliminary work on integrating these features into machine learning pipelines has been initiated. Additionally, I established connectivity between Python and PostgreSQL to streamline the process of extracting data for analysis and feeding it into machine learning models.</p2>
<p3>My accomplishments this semester demonstrate significant progress toward project goals. I successfully:
1.	Designed and implemented a relational database in PostgreSQL, complete with all necessary tables and relationships.
2.	Created a robust Python script to generate and populate realistic NFL data into the database.
3.	Established seamless connectivity between Python and PostgreSQL for data retrieval and analysis.
4.	Investigated machine learning algorithms suitable for the project and defined key metrics for prediction.
These milestones provide a strong foundation for further work, as the database is operational and ready to support the analytical and predictive aspects of the project.

<p4> This semester has been a valuable learning experience, both technically and personally. I encountered numerous challenges, including resolving foreign key constraints, aligning Python-generated data with database structures, finding a reliable data source, and ensuring type compatibility in SQL. Each issue required patience and determination to successfully resolve the problems. Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of relational database management, data generation, and integration techniques. Another critical lesson was the importance of planning and design. Early in the semester, I realized that a well-structured database and clearly defined objectives were essential for the project’s success. Taking the time to map out relationships between tables and align data formats saved time later when resolving errors. Additionally, experimenting with machine learning algorithms highlighted the need for clean, well-structured data to achieve meaningful results.</p4>
<p5> Next semester, I aim to expand the project by focusing on advanced machine learning implementation and refining the database further to accommodate additional data sources. Specifically, I plan to:
1.	Develop and train machine learning models using logistic regression, random forests, and ridge/lasso regression, leveraging the database for input features.
2.	Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision, iterating on the models for optimization.
3.	Introduce web scraping or API integrations to enrich the database with real NFL data, ensuring the models are trained on diverse and up-to-date datasets.
4.	Build a user-friendly visualization dashboard to present predictions and insights, making the project accessible and actionable for end users.

<p6> The progress made this semester has been substantial, laying a strong foundation for the predictive analytics project. By addressing technical challenges and focusing on the integration of data and machine learning, I have created a framework that is both functional and scalable. Next semester’s focus on advanced algorithms, real-world data integration, and visualization will move the project closer to its goal of providing meaningful insights into NFL performance metrics. This journey has enhanced my technical skills and my ability to manage and execute a complex, multi-faceted project.</p6>
